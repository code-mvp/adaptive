## adaptive

Simple adaptive image server based on [smartcrop.js](https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js)

![Example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1086f55f4396e6c34f076b8f4a43c083fc5253d1/687474703a2f2f3239612e63682f73616e64626f782f323031342f736d61727463726f702f6578616d706c652e6a7067)

## Usage

Adaptive exposes a single function that creates an [Express](expressjs.com) app:
```js
var adaptive = require('adaptive');

var opts = {
  secret: 'mysecret',
  cache: '/tmp/adaptive'
};

adaptive(opts).listen(3000);
```

The generated images will be stored in the filesystem. If you don't specify a
`cache` directory, adaptive will store the files in the system's [temp
directory](http://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).

## REST API

You can request images using the following URL pattern:

`http://localhost:3000/<auth-key>/<width>x<height>/<src-url>`


The following URL will generate a 200x200 crop from the example image shown above:
[http://localhost:3000/unsafe/200x200/https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5189/â€¦](http://localhost:3000/unsafe/200x200/https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5189/5682480447_2b7f74b4bd_b.jpg)

### Compression Settings

You can parametrize the JPEG compression by adding `:<quality>` where _quality_
is a value from 0 to 100, optionally followed by a `p` to create a progressive
JPEG.

Examples:

* `http://localhost:3000/unsafe/200x200:75/<src-url>` 75% quality
* `http://localhost:3000/unsafe/200x200:p/<src-url>` progressive, default quality
* `http://localhost:3000/unsafe/200x200:75p/<src-url>` 75% quality, progressive


## Security

In order to prevent DoS attacks _adaptive_ allows you to specify shared secret
that is used to generate a [hash-based message authentication code](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code).

The web server that serves a page which contains adaptive images generates an
_auth key_ for the _options_ and _src-url_.

When end-users access the page and thus load the image, adaptive generates
a key using the same algorithm. If both auth keys match, the request is
processed.

### Generating auth-keys

Adaptive uses standard HMAC with SHA1 signing.

In order to convert `http://example.com/unsafe/200x200/path/to/image.jpg`
into a _safe_ URL we must sign the part `200x200/path/to/image.jpg`

1. Generate a signature of that part using HMAC-SHA1 with the _secret_.
2. Encode the signature as base64.
3. Replace `+` by `-`
4. Replace `/` by `_`
5. Replace `unsafe` at the beginning of the URL with the generated key

## CLI

Adaptive also comes with a binary that can be used to start a HTTP server:

`adaptive -p <port> -s <secret> -c <cache-dir>`

Alternatively the options can be set using environment variables:

`PORT=3000 SECRET=mysecret npm start`

## Deploying to Heroku/dokku

The easiest way to deploy _adaptive_ to Heroku or a dokku instance is to create
an empty project with nothing but a `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-adaptive-images",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": { "adaptive": "*" },
  "scripts": { "start": "adaptive" }
}
```

### Prerequisites

Adpative uses [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) which in
turn is based on Cairo. For system-specific installation instructions please
refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/).

Dokku's Ubuntu image provides all required dependencies except for `libgif`.
The easiest way to add it is to do this:
```
echo https://github.com/fgnass/buildpack-install > .buildpacks
echo https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs >> .buildpacks
echo apt-get install -y libgif-dev > .install

git add .buildpacks .install
git commit -m "add node-canvas prerequisites"
```

### Logging

You can turn on [debug](https://www.npmjs.org/package/debug) output by setting
the `DEBUG` env var to `adaptive:*`
